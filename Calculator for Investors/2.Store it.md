# Stage 2/4: Store it
## Description
A **database** is an organized collection of data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

Let's create a database. In this stage, your program will read the files and create a database with them.  
Follow the objectives and examples to improve your program.

companies.csv
financial.csv

## Objectives
Let's break the task into several steps:
* Read the data from _test/companies.csv_ and _test/financial.csv_;
* Replace the empty values with `None`;
* Create an SQLite database — `investor.db`;
* Create the `companies` table;
* Create the `financial` table;
* Insert datasets to the tables;
* End the program with a message: `Database created successfully!`;

The snippet below shows the detail of the `companies` model. Please don't change the terms and types.
```markdown
ticker: String, primary_key
name: String
sector: String
```
The snippet below shows the details of the `financial` model. Please don't change the terms and types.
```markdown
ticker: String, primary_key

```
