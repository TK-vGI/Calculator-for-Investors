# Stage 1/4: What's on the menu?
## Description
Create a menu for your program and ask users what to do. If users select to end the program, quit with a farewell message.

## Objectives
Let's break the task into several steps:
* Create the `MAIN MENU`, `CRUD MENU`, and the `TOP TEN MENU`;
* Display the `MAIN MENU`;`
* Ask for an option: `Enter an option:`;
* Display the selected menu;
* Ask for an option: `Enter an option:`;
* When a valid option is selected, print `Not implemented!`;
* When an invalid option is selected, print `Invalid option!`;
* Quit with a farewell message: `Have a nice day!`;

The code snippets below show the menus:
```markdown
MAIN MENU
0 Exit
1 CRUD operations
2 Show top ten companies by criteria
```

```markdown
CRUD MENU
0 Back
1 Create a company
2 Read a company
3 Update a company
4 Delete a company
5 List all companies
```

```markdown
TOP TEN MENU
0 Back
1 List by ND/EBITDA
2 List by ROE
3 List by ROA
```
