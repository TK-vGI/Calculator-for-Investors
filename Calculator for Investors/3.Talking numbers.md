# Stage 3/4: Talking numbers
## Description
Keep the functionality from the former steps and implement CRUD MENU. Your program will create an item, read it,  
update it, and delete an item in the database.

[companies.csv](companies.csv)  
[financial.csv](financial.csv)

## Objectives
Let's break the task into several steps:
* Start with the welcoming message: `Welcome to the Investor Program!`
* Display `MAIN MENU`;
* Ask for an option;
* When `CRUD MENU `is selected, display the menu and ask for an option;

  * When `Create a company` is selected;
    * Ask for related values;
    * Create a company in the `companies` table;
    * Create the financial data in the `financial` table;
    * Print `Company created successfully!`;
    * Return to the main menu;

  * When `Read a company` is selected;
    * Ask for a name `Enter company name`:;
    * When no match is found, print `Company not found!` and return to the main menu;
    * When a match is found, list the matching companies with indexes;
    * Ask for a number `Enter company number`:
    * Calculate the financial indicators with the given formulas below;
    * Print them with the company name and ticker;
    * Return to the main menu;

  * When `Update a company` is selected;
    * Ask for a name `Enter company name`:;
    * When no match is found, print `Company not found!` and return to the main menu;
    * When a match is found, list the matching companies with indexes;
    * Ask for a number `Enter company number`:;
    * Ask for the related values;
    * Updates the values and print `Company updated successfully!`;
    * Return to the main menu;

  * When `Delete a company` is selected;
    * Ask for a name: `Enter company name`:;
    * When no match is found, print `Company not found!` and return to the main menu;
    * When a match is found, list the matching companies with indexes;
    * Ask for a number `Enter company number`:;
    * Delete the company, print `Company deleted successfully!`;
    * Return to the main menu;

  * When `List all companies` is selected;
    * Print `COMPANY LIST` as heading;
    * Print the ticker, name, and industry ordered by ticker from the `companies` table;
    * Return to the main menu;

  * While `TOP TEN MENU` is selected, display the menu;
    * Ask for an option;
    * When a valid option is selected, print `Not implemented!`;
    * When an invalid option is selected, print `Invalid option!`;

* Quit with a farewell message: `Have a nice day!`;
